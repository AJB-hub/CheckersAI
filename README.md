## CheckersAI: A small personal leap into  world of machine learning and AI.
### Goals
- Design a system that can interact with a person via a window and play checkers, with the AI using tree search methods to play its moves
- Identify a simple and effective method of transcribing checkers board states to a 2D matrix of integers. 
* 8x8 matrix with 1 for white, -1 for black, and 0 for an empty square
* 
- Will initially begin with python althouth may switch to C++ once I am more comfortable with the language.
- Get a better understanding of Trees and how to search through them
- Implement Matrix multiplication to change between board states



### WIP code
- Currently able to construct a 8x8 matrix of pieces in python, and call functions such as blackMove() or whiteMove() to perform a legal move at the current game state. Each move is chosen sequentially and performs the first legal move it can. Pieces do not interact with each other ie cannot capture pieces yet.
